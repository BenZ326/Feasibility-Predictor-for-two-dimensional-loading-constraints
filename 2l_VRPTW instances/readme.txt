Type I:
All the instances used to produce the training set
Type II-Sol:
All the instances generated from the well-known solomon instances. Items were generated according to "Iori M, Salazar-Gonz√°lez JJ, Vigo D. An exact approach for the vehicle routing problem with two-dimensional loading constraints. Transportation science. 2007 May;41(2):253-64." 
Type II-Kh:
All the instances in "Khebbache-Hadji S, Prins C, Yalaoui A, Reghioui M. Heuristics and memetic algorithm for the two-dimensional loading capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows. Central European Journal of Operations Research. 2013 Mar 1;21(2):307-36."
