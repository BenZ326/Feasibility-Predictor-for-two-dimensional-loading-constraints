# Feasibility-Predictor-for-two-dimensional-loading-constraints
This is a repo to present how to apply a feasibility predictor for the two-dimensional loading constraints. Once could open up the .ipynp in the repo to see the instruction. If you have any question regarding the predictor, feel free to contact me. Here is my [personal website](https://arccos0.github.io/).
