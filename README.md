# Feasibility-Predictor-for-two-dimensional-loading-constraints
## This is a repo for the paper "Learning-based branch-and-price algorithms for a vehicle routing problem with time windows and two-dimensional loading constraints".
### The repo includes:
* The training samples
* The testing samples
* All the instances used to generate the training samples
* The trained feasibility predictor
* The codes to deploy the feasibility predictor in C++ 
* The instruction to show how to parse the training, testing samples and apply the feasibility predictor in python.
#### Format of the files:
The .pt file in the repo is a serilized format of the predictor. One could parse the file in either python or C++. The .ipynp file gives the details of the instruction, which is written in python and depends on Pytorch. You could directly click it online to check! <br>
