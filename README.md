# Feasibility-Predictor-for-two-dimensional-loading-constraints
# This is a simple instruction on how to apply the feasibility predictor. The main steps include:<br>
* Load the feasibility predictor
* Parse a packing instance
* Pass the feature of the instance to the predictor and obtain the prediction
