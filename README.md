# Feasibility-Predictor-for-two-dimensional-loading-constraints
# This is a simple instruction on how to apply the feasibility predictor. The main steps include:<br>
* Load the feasibility predictor
* Parse a packing instance
* Pass the feature of the instance to the predictor and obtain the prediction
------------------
The .pt file in the repo is a serilized format of the predictor. One could parse the file in either python or C++. The .ipynp file gives the details of the instruction, which is written in python and depends on Pytorch. <br>
If you have any question regarding the predictor, feel free to contact me through my [personal website](https://arccos0.github.io/).
