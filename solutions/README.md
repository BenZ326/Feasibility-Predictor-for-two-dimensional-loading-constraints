# Feasibility-Predictor-for-two-dimensional-loading-constraints
## Folder - Solution
The folder contains all the detailed solutions of Table 6, Table B1 and Table B2 in the paper.
For example A102, the BP-AD algorithm got the following solution:
320.2  `represents the objective value`
0,12,16 `Route 0` 
0,4,13,14,6,16  `Route 1`
0,7,8,1,16 `Route 2`
0,5,15,9,10,16 `Route 3`
0,2,3,11,16 `Route 4`

As for the packing part, check `./BP-AD-packings/A102`.
